### Overview

Wen-Chien is a pediatrician from Taiwan. Her research interests center around the 
intersection of maternal and child health, healthcare quality, and health 
service delivery. She is passionate about how to address the gap 
between pregnant women and children who need health services and those 
who receive services and experience desired health outcomes. In the 
Smith Lab, she has done a systematic review and meta-analysis on feeding 
guidelines for preterm babies, and is now working on another systematic 
review about the effects of prenatal vitamin D supplementation on maternal, 
neonatal, and infant outcomes.
