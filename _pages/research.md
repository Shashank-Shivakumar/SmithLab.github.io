<h2>Covid 19</h2>
<p>Dr. Smith is the founder and editor-in-chief of COVID-101.org. She launched this project on March 15, 2020, in response to the need for COVID information that is accessible and rooted in science. The project workflow looks like this: readers ask COVID-19 questions, our doctors rapidly review the scientific evidence, and the team delivers simple answers to an array of platforms (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and the web). More than 25 volunteers contribute to COVID-101, including epidemiologists and infectious disease physicians from a dozen colleges and universities (University of Washington, Columbia, Johns Hopkins, Harvard, George Washington University, and more).<br><br>
Dr. Smith is the principle investigator for the Perinatal COVID-19 Sequential Prospective Meta-Analysis Project (sPMA) funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. While many national registries, health facilities, and research groups are collecting data about SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy and in the newborn period, the sPMA is a collaborative and methodologically appropriate effort to pool and analyze this data. More than 100 investigators and stakeholders working in 41 countries are participating in the project with an aim of rapidly answering high priority questions about COVID-19.</p>

<h2>The Effect of Early Breastfeeding Initiation on Infant Morbidity and Mortality</h2>
<p>Dr. Smith has published several papers showing a link between breastfeeding initiation time and infant morbidity and mortality (Smith et al The Journal of Pediatrics 2107; Smith et al PloS one 2017; Neovita Study Group Lancet Global Health 2016). However, the mechanism through which early newborn nutrition has a long-term health impact is not known. Some have hypothesized that early breastfeeding may decrease the risk of microbial translocation, accelerate intestinal maturation, promote resistance to and epithelial recovery from infection, and protect against environmental enteric dysfunction (EED). But there is limited data about these potential mechanisms. Dr. Smith and colleagues recently completed a study among a cohort of children enrolled in a micronutrient trial in Tanzania; both delayed breastfeeding initiation and prelacteal feeding were associated with elevated biomarkers of poor gut function later in infancy. Dr. Smith led four systematic reviews to support development of the 2020 WHO Guidelines on care and feeding of low birthweight infants.</p>
