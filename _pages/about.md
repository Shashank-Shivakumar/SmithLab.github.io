# About this website

Our website is based on the open source templates designed and shared by the labs of [D. Allan Drummond](http://www.allanlab.org/aboutwebsite.html), [Trevor Bedford](http://bedford.io/misc/about/) and [Stephan Sanders](https://sanderslab.github.io). We downloaded source codes from their repository and modified our contents based on shared templates. We greatly thank them for allowing reuse of their codebase. 

The website is deployed using [GitHub Pages](https://SmithLabGWSPH.github.io) and the source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/SmithLabGWSPH/SmithLabGWSPH.github.io). Please feel free to reuse this code (making sure to cite the Bedford lab, Drummond lab and Sanders Lab as the original sources of the lab website template).
